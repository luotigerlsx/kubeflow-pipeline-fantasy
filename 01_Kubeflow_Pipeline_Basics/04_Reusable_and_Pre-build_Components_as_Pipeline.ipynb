    "\n",
    "- Write the program that contains your componentâ€™s logic. The program must use files and command-line arguments to pass data to and from the component.\n",
    "- Containerize the program.\n",
    "- Write a component specification in YAML format that describes the component for the Kubeflow Pipelines system.\n",
    "- Use the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK to load your component, use it in a pipeline and run that pipeline.\n",

    "- Deploy the exported TensorFlow model on AI Platform Prediction service.\n",

    "Interacting with AI Platform services, e.g. training and prediction, will require the access of the endpoint. There are two options available, i.e., **global endpoint** and **regional endpoint**:\n",
    "- When you create a model resource on the global endpoint, you can specify a region for your model. When you create versions within this model and serve predictions, the prediction nodes run in the specified region. \n",
    "- When you use a regional endpoint, AI Platform Prediction runs your prediction nodes in the endpoint's region. However, in this case AI Platform Prediction provides additional isolation by running all AI Platform Prediction infrastructure in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you use the us-east1 region on the global endpoint, your prediction nodes run in us-east1. But the AI Platform Prediction infrastructure managing your resources (routing requests; handling model and version creation, updates, and deletion; etc.) does not necessarily run in us-east1. On the other hand, if you use the europe-west4 regional endpoint, your prediction nodes and all AI Platform Prediction infrastructure run in europe-west4.\n",
